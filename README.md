# 🏏 Bowling Run Analysis using YOLOv8 and MediaPipe

This project analyzes the run-up of a cricket bowler using advanced computer vision techniques. It uses **YOLOv8** for object detection and **MediaPipe Pose** for body landmark estimation. The goal is to track the bowler’s position across video frames, compute distances using known reference points, and visualize motion trajectories for performance insights.
